# alfred
An R-package for obtaining vintage data from ALFRED: https://alfred.stlouisfed.org. Note that this product uses the FRED&copy; API but is not endorsed or certified by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.

## Highlights
  - Simple-to-use function for downloading real-time data from ALFRED at different points in time.
  - Returns tidy data frames for further analysis, see https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html.
  - Contrary to similar R-packages, you don't have to get an API-key yourself.
  
## Usage
A more detailed example can be found in my vignette: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/alfred/vignettes/alfred.html

```r
library(alfred)
# Download industrial production index releases from March 2015 for 2013.
get_alfred_series("INDPRO", "test",
                  observation_start = "2013-03-01", observation_end = "2013-03-30",
                  realtime_start = "2015-02-02", realtime_end = "2015-02-02")
# Wrapper for getting only most recent releases 
get_fred_series("INDPRO", "indpro", observation_start = "2009-03-01", observation_end = "2009-03-01")
```

## Installation

Development version (GitHub):
```r

install_github("onnokleen/alfred")

### Terms of use
